# Medium Table of Contents Generator

A simple web app that generates a Table of Contents (TOC) for Medium articles.

**Why?** Medium doesnâ€™t support automatic TOC generation.

## What it does

- Extracts all headings from a Medium article
- Preserves the order and indentation based on heading level
- Shows each heading's ID so you can manually create internal links
