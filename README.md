A simple web app that generates a Table of Contents (TOC) for Medium articles.

**Why?** Medium doesn’t support automatic TOC generation.

## What it does

- Extracts all section headings from a Medium article
- Keeps their order and indentation (based on heading level)
- Shows each heading’s ID so you can manually add internal links
